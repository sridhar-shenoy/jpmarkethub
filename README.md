# MarketHub Application - High-Performance Market Data Aggregation System

# Problem Statement  
Write a Gateway that conects to two market data publisher
  1. BidAndOffer
  2. LastPrice
     
The application must consume these two sources and publish data to internal JP consumer who will parse the collated data

## Key Features
### ðŸ”’ Thread-Safe Lock-Free Implementation
- Lock-free data structures and busy-wait patterns
### ðŸ§¹ Zero Garbage Architecture
- Pre-allocated Ring buffer reuse
- Application does not create object runtime 
## Architecture Design

![System Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c91d180f-81f9-4003-93c8-71c6c80cd64f)  
*Real-Time Data Processing Pipeline with Zero GC Overhead*


## Core Components
```plaintext
+----------------+       +-----------------+       +-------------------+
|  Exchange Data | ---> | MarketHub App    | ---> | Internal consumer  |
+----------------+       +-----------------+       +-------------------+
                              â–²
                              â”‚
                      +-----------------+
                      | Ring Buffer Pool |
                      +-----------------+
```

## Api Specification of the Producers
1. The **BidAndOffer** is Published on port 9000
```
SequenceNo,BidPrice,OfferPrice;
```
2. The **LastPrice** is Published on Port 9001
```
SequenceNo,LastPrice;
```

## Api Specification For Internal Consumers
Currently All Internal Cosnumers can connect via TCP connection to port **10000** to subscribe to Collated Data
1. The **BidAndOfferLastPrice** is Published wis published as below 
```
SequenceNo,BidPrice,OfferPrice,LastPrice
```
# Archetecture Design 

## MarketHub
1. **Market Hub** is the main application that initiates connections to Multiple Market Data source
  - For Each of these Connection MarketHub assignes a ring Buffer dedicated to this Producer
  - As and when data arrives from this Producer, ring buffer is populated and current valid sequence updated
2. Market Hub exposes multiple ports for any internal clients to connect
   - Whenever a client connects on a port, MarketHub attahes it to a **busy spin thread**
   - this Consumer class will always monitor the Ringbuffer via a volatile variable to process any new data
   - when there is data available, Consumer will collate the data and publish to all connected clients
